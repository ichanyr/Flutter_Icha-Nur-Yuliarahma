The presence of both mental and physical health issues can complicate treatment approaches and require a multidisciplinary approach.

It is important to note that mental health issues affect individuals differently, and the pros and cons may vary from person to person. Seeking professional help and support is crucial for addressing mental health concerns effectively.
